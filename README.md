# Genome Sequence REPL
### fp-2024.  Justas DrakÅ¡as, group 5.

All living entities posses genetic information which determines most traits and characteristics\
 of an organism. Nucleotides are the buildings blocks of DNA and RNA and by analysing sequences\
  of them we can gain understand the genetic code. This REPL program helps with such tasks.

## Entities:

- **Nucleotides**: Represented by the letters A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine). 

- **Sequences**:  Sequences (strings) of nucleotides (AGGCTA).

-  **Motifs**: Specific patterns or repeated sequences within a nucleotide sequence.


## Operations
- **Concatenation**: Combining two nucleotide sequences into one.

- **Finding Motifs**: Finding the location of a certain string of nucleotides within a larger one.

- **Complement**: Computing the complementary nucleotide sequence (AACG -> TTGC).

- **Transcription**: Converting a DNA sequence into its RNA equivalent. (ATCGT -> AUCGU).
